Instructions:
 
Simply type "make" to compile. To run, enter "p2" followed by the name of the input file containing the polyhedron data you would like
to specify. The values making up the vertices in this file may be positive or negative. If any value exceeds an absolute value of 500.0,
the violating polyhedron portion will be clipped in its rendering. These polyhedrons will be rendered as wireframes and projected 
orthographically into three views: XY/top/elevation, XZ/front/plan, and YZ/side/section. 

Once the polyhedrons have been rendered, you may right click anywhere on the primary viewing window (but outside any of the three projection
subwindows) and a menu will appear. In this menu you may select to translate, scale, rotate, or display the vertices of any of the poyhedrons 
pictured. 


To translate: 
When prompted, type the desired x, y, and z world coordinate values of translation, in that order, and hit enter.

To scale: 
When prompted, type the magnitude of the scaling and hit enter. 

To rotate: 
When prompted, type the x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, and z2 values representing the line around which the desired polyhedron will be rotated, followed by the 
angle of rotation in radians. A positive angle will rotate the selected polygon counter-clockwise from the perspective of facing in the negative
direction down the axis of rotation. 

To view a polyhedron's vertices:
No actions are required beyond selecting your polyhedron of choice.   


The following algorithm/code line references indicate that algorithm's implemenation location as found in main.cpp:

XY Projection.....................................................39-62
XZ Projection.....................................................63-109
YZ Projection.....................................................87-110
Vertex Dump.......................................................130-144
Translation.......................................................145-179
Scaling...........................................................180-232
Rotation..........................................................233-328

Everything implemented to carry out the assignment specifications should be fully functional.
